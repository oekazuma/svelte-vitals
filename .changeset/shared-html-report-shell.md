`svelte-vitals --reporter html` and the vite live dashboard now share one renderer (core's new `renderAppShell`), so the two surfaces can't drift apart again. The static HTML report gets the dashboard's full UI — master/detail layout with a searchable, sortable route list, severity/category filters, dark mode, and the per-finding copy-to-clipboard AI Prompt — while staying fully self-contained and offline; the only difference is that the live-update machinery (SSE connection, `measured` refinement, the connection/analyzing indicators) is absent when there is no dev server behind the page. `@svelte-vitals/core` gains `renderAppShell`/`AppSnapshot`/`RouteBadge`/`APP_SCRIPT`/`APP_STYLE` exports; `buildHtmlDocument`/`formatHtmlReport` keep their signatures but emit the new document. The dashboard itself is unchanged, now served from the shared shell.
