Add `correctness/nonreactive-builtin-state`: flags plain `Map`/`Set`/`Date`/`URL`/`URLSearchParams` in `$state` whose mutations are observed — `$state`'s deep proxy covers plain objects and arrays only, so such mutations are untracked and the UI silently stops updating. Precision-first: only type-specific mutating operations count, and mutate-then-reassign usage (which works) is not flagged.
