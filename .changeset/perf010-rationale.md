Fix PERF010 (namespace import) rationale: it previously claimed a namespace import always defeats tree-shaking, which over-states the real behavior — bundlers like Rollup/Vite do tree-shake statically-accessed namespace imports. The message now accurately describes when tree-shaking breaks (the namespace object escapes or is accessed dynamically). No detection or severity change.
