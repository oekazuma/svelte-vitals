Agent reporter polish: an invalid `--reporter <value>` now fails fast with exit 2 instead of silently falling back to auto-detection; the agent Markdown report orders findings most-severe-first (critical-bearing files first, severity-sorted within each file) and tells the agent to prioritize critical issues; tag-like tokens (`<title>`, `<meta …>`, `<svelte:head>`) in the agent report are wrapped in inline code so Markdown renderers no longer strip them; rule `fix` templates are now copied per finding rather than shared by reference; and when the agent reporter is auto-selected from the environment (not requested explicitly), a one-line hint is printed to stderr explaining how to override.
