Plugin mode: `@svelte-vitals/vite` analyzes prerendered HTML during `vite build` and runs the full SEO rule set (library-agnostic), gating the build via `failOn`. Console/JSON reports with a per-route score; only prerendered routes are covered. `outFile` is resolved against the project root (parent directories are created), and an internal analysis failure is reported as a warning rather than failing the build (distinct from a real finding). The core console reporter gained an optional `mode` label for the header line, and now exports the shared `ROBOTS_SOURCE_PATHS` / `SITEMAP_SOURCE_PATHS` project-rule path lists used by both modes.
