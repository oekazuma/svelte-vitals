Add a dev-time SvelteKit handle, `svelteVitalsHandle` (exported from `@svelte-vitals/vite/hooks`). Added to `src/hooks.server.ts`, it analyzes each visited page's rendered `<head>` in dev and prints SEO warnings for the current route to the terminal — request-driven, dev-only, and never mutates the response.
