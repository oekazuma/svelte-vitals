Add `correctness/base-path-navigation`: in projects that configure `kit.paths.base`, flags hardcoded root-relative navigation — `<a href="/about">`, `goto('/about')`, `redirect(303, '/login')` — which resolves against the domain root, lands outside the app, and 404s in production while working fine locally. The base path is read from the `sveltekit()` Vite plugin config, else `svelte.config.{js,ts}`, following SvelteKit's own precedence; projects without a base path are never flagged. Detection is literal-only, so `resolve()`-wrapped and `base`-prefixed paths are never reported.
