The dev dashboard (`svelteVitals({ ui: true })`) now runs whole-project static analysis: from the moment `vite dev` starts it shows all routes across every category (SEO, Performance, Correctness, Security, Architecture) with a real project Health — no page visit required. Saving a source file triggers a debounced re-analysis, and visiting a page refines that route with live (rendered) results. Route headings show a `measured` (live) or `static` provenance badge. If the analysis fails, the dashboard falls back to the previous live-only behavior without breaking the dev server. To support the badges, core's `buildHtmlDocument` gains an optional third argument (`opts?: { routeBadges?: Record<string, 'measured' | 'static'> }`); output is unchanged when it is omitted.
