Surface the resolved `@svelte-vitals/core` version so it's possible to tell whether the CLI and the Vite dev overlay are running the same rule engine. `svelte-vitals --version` now prints `<cli version> (core <core version>)`, and the dev overlay's dashboard footer (`/__svelte-vitals/`) shows `core v<version>` alongside its own version. `svelte-vitals` and `@svelte-vitals/vite` are versioned independently and can end up depending on different `@svelte-vitals/core` releases (e.g. a package-manager cooldown like pnpm's `minimumReleaseAge` resolving `@latest` down to an older release) — previously there was no way to notice this without diffing lockfiles, so the two surfaces could silently disagree on findings. See the "Version drift" section in the dev overlay docs.
