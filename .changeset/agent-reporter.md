Agent-native output. Every rule now carries a structured `fix` (instruction + snippet), surfaced in the JSON report and in a new `--reporter agent` Markdown remediation document built for handing findings to an AI coding agent. The CLI auto-selects the agent reporter when run under a known AI-agent harness (`CLAUDECODE`), overridable via `SVELTE_VITALS_REPORTER` or `--reporter`.
