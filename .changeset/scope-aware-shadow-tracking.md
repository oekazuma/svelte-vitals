Fix a false-positive/false-negative source shared by CORRECT004 (unmutated `$state`) and CORRECT005 (mutated non-bindable prop): both matched writes by identifier name alone, so a local binding that reused a tracked `$state`/prop name — a function parameter, a block-scoped `let`/`const` redeclaration, a `for`/`for-of`/`for-in` loop variable, a `catch` clause's parameter, or an `{#each ... as x}` loop variable — was misattributed as a write to the outer binding. CORRECT005 now correctly skips flagging a mutation of such a shadowing local instead of raising a false positive; CORRECT004 now correctly still flags a `$state` as constable when only a shadowing local was ever written, instead of a false negative. `{#snippet}`/`{:then}`/`{:catch}` bindings are not yet tracked — a known, documented remaining gap.
