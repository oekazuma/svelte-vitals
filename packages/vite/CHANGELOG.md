# @svelte-vitals/vite

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3c7c36e: Add a dev-time SvelteKit handle, `svelteVitalsHandle` (exported from `@svelte-vitals/vite/hooks`). Added to `src/hooks.server.ts`, it analyzes each visited page's rendered `<head>` in dev and prints SEO warnings for the current route to the terminal — request-driven, dev-only, and never mutates the response.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fcb0494: Plugin mode: `@svelte-vitals/vite` analyzes prerendered HTML during `vite build` and runs the full SEO rule set (library-agnostic), gating the build via `failOn`. Console/JSON reports with a per-route score; only prerendered routes are covered. `outFile` is resolved against the project root (parent directories are created), and an internal analysis failure is reported as a warning rather than failing the build (distinct from a real finding). The core console reporter gained an optional `mode` label for the header line, and now exports the shared `ROBOTS_SOURCE_PATHS` / `SITEMAP_SOURCE_PATHS` project-rule path lists used by both modes.
