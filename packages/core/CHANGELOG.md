# @svelte-vitals/core

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 2857e16: Add the Performance category (v0.4, #10): static `<img>` checks — **PERF001** (missing
  `width`/`height`, CLS risk; warning) and **PERF002** (missing `loading` attribute; info
  advisory) — with dynamically-bound attributes counting as present. Introduces the
  multi-category foundation: `Result.category`/`line`, the `ImageInfo`/`ResolvedImages` IR,
  `RuleContext.images`, `imageRule`, `scoresByCategory`, and category-aware reporters
  (per-category scores; JSON `categories` map). Existing SEO findings, scores, and output
  are unchanged.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 6f3aeec: Formalize the ESM-only stance (#20): drop the legacy top-level `main`/`types` from
  `@svelte-vitals/core` and `@svelte-vitals/vite` so every package is `exports`-only,
  add `sideEffects: false` across all packages for consistent tree-shaking, declare
  `"engines": { "node": ">=18" }` on every package so the documented runtime floor is
  machine-enforceable, and document the ESM-only (Node 18+, `require()` unsupported by
  design) requirement in each README. CI now guards type-resolution with
  `@arethetypeswrong/cli` (esm-only profile) alongside publint.

  `core` and `vite` get a `minor` bump because dropping top-level `main`/`types` can
  affect consumers/tools that resolve entry points without `exports` support (e.g.
  `moduleResolution: node`); `svelte-vitals` and `@svelte-vitals/mcp` only gain the
  additive `sideEffects: false` and `engines` declaration, so they stay `patch`.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 396a783: Add `@svelte-vitals/mcp`, a Model Context Protocol server exposing `analyze` and `explain_rule` tools over stdio (#24). Core gains `buildJsonReport`, `explainRule`, `RuleInfo`, and `docsUrlFor`; the JSON report's per-finding objects now include `docsUrl`; the CLI gains `analyzeProject` for reuse.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 762d4d1: Add SARIF 2.1.0 (`--reporter sarif`) and GitHub Actions workflow-command (`--reporter github`) reporters. The `github` reporter is auto-selected under GitHub Actions for inline PR annotations; SARIF can be uploaded to GitHub code scanning.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e60d033: Agent-native output. Every rule now carries a structured `fix` (instruction + snippet), surfaced in the JSON report and in a new `--reporter agent` Markdown remediation document built for handing findings to an AI coding agent. The CLI auto-selects the agent reporter when run under a known AI-agent harness (`CLAUDECODE`), overridable via `SVELTE_VITALS_REPORTER` or `--reporter`.

### Patch Changes

- eb97f09: Agent reporter polish: an invalid `--reporter <value>` now fails fast with exit 2 instead of silently falling back to auto-detection; the agent Markdown report orders findings most-severe-first (critical-bearing files first, severity-sorted within each file) and tells the agent to prioritize critical issues; tag-like tokens (`<title>`, `<meta …>`, `<svelte:head>`) in the agent report are wrapped in inline code so Markdown renderers no longer strip them; rule `fix` templates are now copied per finding rather than shared by reference; and when the agent reporter is auto-selected from the environment (not requested explicitly), a one-line hint is printed to stderr explaining how to override.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fcb0494: Plugin mode: `@svelte-vitals/vite` analyzes prerendered HTML during `vite build` and runs the full SEO rule set (library-agnostic), gating the build via `failOn`. Console/JSON reports with a per-route score; only prerendered routes are covered. `outFile` is resolved against the project root (parent directories are created), and an internal analysis failure is reported as a warning rather than failing the build (distinct from a real finding). The core console reporter gained an optional `mode` label for the header line, and now exports the shared `ROBOTS_SOURCE_PATHS` / `SITEMAP_SOURCE_PATHS` project-rule path lists used by both modes.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 08b6d74: Static-mode finishing: scored SEO report.

  - New rules SEO002–SEO009 (description, canonical, og:image, og:title, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, JSON-LD, `<html lang>`).
  - Scoring model (§12): per-route scores, route average, site penalty, and a critical cap, surfaced in the console header and JSON.
  - JSON reporter (`--json` / `--reporter json`) and `--by-route` per-route tree.
  - New flags: `--fail-on`/`--fail-on-warning`, `--rules`/`--ignore`. `treatDynamicAs: 'warn'` now reports dynamic values as warnings.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e3228ca: Detection layers 2–4: resolve head metadata set via components, not just literal `<svelte:head>`.

  - Built-in adapters for `svelte-meta-tags` (`MetaTags`) and `svelte-seo`.
  - Transitive resolution of custom `src/` components (depth-limited, cycle-guarded).
  - `--meta-components` flag to declare opaque meta components, plus `--treat-dynamic-as` and `--route` flags.
  - Components recognized as meta sources suppress false "missing" verdicts; unknown components do not.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4786248: Initial release: the static-mode SEO foundation.

  - `npx svelte-vitals` scans a SvelteKit project and checks `<title>` presence (SEO001) by statically parsing `<svelte:head>` with `svelte/compiler`, resolving the full layout chain (`+layout.svelte` → … → `+page.svelte`).
  - Two-axis detection (presence × value): a dynamic title such as `<title>{data.title}</title>` is recognized and never reported as missing; it passes with a `↯` marker. Only genuinely missing or empty metadata is flagged.
  - Runtime-agnostic `@svelte-vitals/core` (types, rule engine, reporter) with a `Runtime` I/O abstraction, plus a Node adapter in the CLI. Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` critical finding, `2` execution error.
