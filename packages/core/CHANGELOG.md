# @svelte-vitals/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fcb0494: Plugin mode: `@svelte-vitals/vite` analyzes prerendered HTML during `vite build` and runs the full SEO rule set (library-agnostic), gating the build via `failOn`. Console/JSON reports with a per-route score; only prerendered routes are covered. `outFile` is resolved against the project root (parent directories are created), and an internal analysis failure is reported as a warning rather than failing the build (distinct from a real finding). The core console reporter gained an optional `mode` label for the header line, and now exports the shared `ROBOTS_SOURCE_PATHS` / `SITEMAP_SOURCE_PATHS` project-rule path lists used by both modes.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 08b6d74: Static-mode finishing: scored SEO report.

  - New rules SEO002–SEO009 (description, canonical, og:image, og:title, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, JSON-LD, `<html lang>`).
  - Scoring model (§12): per-route scores, route average, site penalty, and a critical cap, surfaced in the console header and JSON.
  - JSON reporter (`--json` / `--reporter json`) and `--by-route` per-route tree.
  - New flags: `--fail-on`/`--fail-on-warning`, `--rules`/`--ignore`. `treatDynamicAs: 'warn'` now reports dynamic values as warnings.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e3228ca: Detection layers 2–4: resolve head metadata set via components, not just literal `<svelte:head>`.

  - Built-in adapters for `svelte-meta-tags` (`MetaTags`) and `svelte-seo`.
  - Transitive resolution of custom `src/` components (depth-limited, cycle-guarded).
  - `--meta-components` flag to declare opaque meta components, plus `--treat-dynamic-as` and `--route` flags.
  - Components recognized as meta sources suppress false "missing" verdicts; unknown components do not.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4786248: Initial release: the static-mode SEO foundation.

  - `npx svelte-vitals` scans a SvelteKit project and checks `<title>` presence (SEO001) by statically parsing `<svelte:head>` with `svelte/compiler`, resolving the full layout chain (`+layout.svelte` → … → `+page.svelte`).
  - Two-axis detection (presence × value): a dynamic title such as `<title>{data.title}</title>` is recognized and never reported as missing; it passes with a `↯` marker. Only genuinely missing or empty metadata is flagged.
  - Runtime-agnostic `@svelte-vitals/core` (types, rule engine, reporter) with a `Runtime` I/O abstraction, plus a Node adapter in the CLI. Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` critical finding, `2` execution error.
